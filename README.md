Our organization works primarily in the field of visual geometry. Carry out research work on the application of various vision technologies for on-orbit spacecraft.

## Research Background
As space technology has been leaping forward, a wide variety of space structures (e.g., space antenna, space telescope, and space solar array) are rapidly advancing towards large-scale, high-precision and deployable space structures. In order to verify the reliability of the structure and monitor its functional performance, all large space structures will undergo a series of rigorous ground-based or space-based tests. PG shows the advantages of non-contact, large-scale, high-precision, multi-point simultaneous measuring, and others. It especially applies to the fast measurement of large structures movement and deformation. As the space camera thermal control system is rapidly advancing, the PG system has been well applied to a series of LSS ground-based or space-based measurement tasks.
